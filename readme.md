1. Introduction

Lazor is a puzzle game for Android and iOS that challenges players to guide a laser beam through specific target points by strategically placing square blocks. There are three types of blocks to work with:

Reflect: A white block that bounces the laser beam.
Opaque: A dark block that stops the laser beam.
Refract: A transparent block that allows the laser to pass through while also reflecting it.

In the game’s basic free version, players get only three hints. This project’s aim is to create a universal program that can solve any Lazor puzzle.


2. Methodology

The grid should be placed between GRID START and GRID STOP.
A: Reflect block
B: Opaque block
C: Refract block
L: The first two numbers stand for the laser's start coordinates, the last two numbers stand for the laser's direction.
P: The positions that lazers need to intersect.



4. Understanding the Code

White Block: Reflect block

Black Block: Opaque block

Red Block: Refract block

Lighter Gray Block: The location where the block can be placed

Darker Gray Block: The location where the block cannot be placed.

Hollow Red Circle: The end point the laser needs to pass.

Solid Red Circle: The place where the laser is emitted.

Red Line: The optical path of the laser.

5. File generation
Codes were written in parts and assembled into a final file (final name of the file) All other codes are in the subsequent branches.

6. Runtime
It takes xx seconds to run the code

7. Contribution: We all cooperate to finish the rest of the project together

Shavier: Identifies logic for class GameBoard and(updating it)

Gabriele: Verification (bff files), Validation (Verified logic for the code), 

Vasuudhaa: Input, output of code, Readme.md (description of lazor project), Validation (Verified bff files)
