1. Introduction
Lazor is a puzzle game for Android and iOS that challenges players to guide a laser beam through specific target points by strategically placing square blocks. There are three types of blocks to work with:

Reflect: A white block that bounces the laser beam.
Opaque: A dark block that stops the laser beam.
Refract: A transparent block that allows the laser to pass through while also reflecting it.

In the game’s basic free version, players get only three hints. This project’s aim is to create a universal program that can solve any Lazor puzzle.
