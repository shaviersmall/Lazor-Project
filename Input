Lazor Project: Lazor game solution generator
Authors: Gabriele Pierre, Vasuudhaa Sonawane, Shavier Small
This script accepts a Lazor game
specification file in the ".bff" format as input.
It utilizes a random iterative approach to solve the game
and produces a solution file in a format similar to the input.

Input:
This script takes a Lazor game specification file
in the ".bff" format as input.
It employs a random iterative approach to solve the
game and generates a solution file in a format similar to the input.

*Input*
	The input file .bff contains the following information:
    starting layout of the game grid, types and quantities of  
    available blocks, laser sources and paths, and intercept positions.
	x = no block allowed
	o = blocks allowed
	A = fixed reflect block
	B = fixed opaque block
	C = fixed refract block

	Axes defining block, laser and intercept positioning are as followed:
	Horizontal right : +x
	Vertical bottom : +y
